# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
The main objectives of this project are to predict fraudulent transactions from genuine ones and to understand the various attributes that help determine whether a credit card transaction is a fraudulent one or not. I processed the data using various statistical tools to address the imbalanced nature of our dataset. I used five classifier techniques: logistic regression, k-nearest neighbor, neural network, support vector machine and random forest for accurate predictions. Then, I used ensemble method of majority vote to improve our results by combining several models. Furthermore, I evaluated our ensemble model and further improved the accuracy with an advanced stacking method. Finally, I identified the best indicators of detecting fraudulent credit card transactions.
